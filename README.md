# The-World-Happiness-Report-2022

Here is my infographic for the April D'Challenger challenge.

This month the challenge was based on creating a visual using the data from the World Happiness Report.

The infographic explores what countries are happy and why.

Please click on the link below, open the visual in full screen and hover over a Country to see its ranking in terms of happiness and how its value in terms of economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.
